## Project definition

The idea for this project is to show the best location where setting up a bar/restaurant whose objective is to serve as a nexus between different companies. 
After-work culture is gaining relevance and even becoming an essential part in every business. Sacred liquids (also known as beer) allow humans to socialize and often create synergies, businesses and even new ventures. 

**Criterion to optimize the location:**
- Funded companies. They pay income to their employees (instead of equity) that can spend in our restaurant/bar.
- Companies with at least 10 employees.
- Technological companies might be more interesting since trending topics meetups might attract more consumers. 
- Different offices from the same company might be interesting for special events.


**Steps:**
1. Using MongoDB, create a new database and import the json with the data.
2. Write a first query filtering essential data.
3. Clean and prepare the dataset to work with.
4. Export a json including the geopoint and set a geoquery using MongoDB.
5. Print a map showing all the companies we filtered before.
6. Choose the best point and create a report using a pipelines.
